Scientific-Calculator-Python

About Me
Hi! I am a beginner learning Python programming. I created this interactive calculator to practice and improve my skills. I am open to any suggestions or improvements from more experienced programmers.

Features
Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
Root calculation: r (x^(1/y))
Modulo operation: %
Integer division: //
Pi input: type P to use the value of Ï€
Continuous calculations using the previous result
Operation history to track all calculations

How to Use
1 - Clone or download the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Scientific-Calculator-Python.git

2 - Run the calculator in Python (version 3.x recommended):
python calculator.py

3 - Follow the prompts:
Enter numbers (or P for Pi)
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /, r, %, //)
See the result and optionally continue with the previous result
View the history of all operations

Examples
Enter first number: 10
Enter operation: +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 10 + 5 = 15

Next, you can continue with 15 or start a new calculation.
